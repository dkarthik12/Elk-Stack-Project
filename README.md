In this project I configured an ELK stack server in order to set up a cloud monitoring system. Deployed containers using Ansible and Docker, Deployed Filebeat using Ansible.

and deployed the ELK stack on a server.


Docker is a software that offers a set of platform-as-a-service products for developing and deploying applications by packaging software in containers.

Containers are lightweight, portable, virtual environments that developers can share without risking inconsistencies in development. Due to these incredibly useful features, many organizations have switched from using virtual machines to Docker containers.

Activities involved the following:

* Created a new vNet in Azure in a different region, within the same resource group.
* Created a peer-to-peer network connection between the vNets.
* Created a new VM in the new vNet that has 2vCPUs and a minimum of 4GiB of memory.
* Added the new VM to Ansible’s hosts file in the provisioner VM.
* Created an Ansible playbook that installs Docker and configures an ELK container.
* Run the playbook to launch the container.
* Restricted access to the ELK VM.

Activities involve the following:

* Navigate to the ELK server’s GUI to view Filebeat installation instructions.
* Create a Filebeat configuration file.
* Create an Ansible playbook that copies this configuration file to the DVWA VMs and then installs Filebeat.
* Run the playbook to install Filebeat.
* Confirm that the ELK Stack is receiving logs.

Filebeat Installation:
Filebeat helps generate and organize log files to send to Logstash and Elasticsearch. Specifically, it logs information about the file system, including which files have changed and when.

Filebeat is often used to collect log files from very specific files, such as those generated by Apache, Microsoft Azure tools, the Nginx web server, and MySQL databases.

Since Filebeat is built to collect data about specific files on remote machines, it must be installed on the VMs you want to monitor.

               The ELK server is receiving logs and I had successfully deployed a live, functional ELK stack and now have plays that can:

* Install and launch Docker containers on a host machine.
* Configure and deploy an ELK server.
* Install Filebeat on any Debian-flavored Linux server.


3. Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application. By utilizing one virtual machine as the "jumpbox," the containers in other VMs can be easily modified if needed without having to login and go through each VM or container individually. Automated and simplified maintenance is key.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly efficient, in addition to keeping traffic in the network running smoothly. By distributing HTTP traffic between webservers, the webservers and the network will not be overwhelmed by hundreds or even thousands of user requests; this is why load balancers are so crucial in cyber security, as they not only help in applications running smoothly, but also help prevent attacks such as DoS attacks.

By intergrating our ELK applications with DVWA and modules such as Filebeat, the webservers can be easily monitored for further analysis, which will be useful in mitigating or spotting an attack.

The details of each machine may be found below. When recreating a similar network, the number of virtual machines holding the DVWA containers is up to the creator's discretion--however, it may be necessary to change the virtual memory size of the ELK container accordingly to keep up with the extra resources being monitored.
 


It should be noted that in this example, the ELK server was placed in its own virtual network, and required peering between networks in order to work with the webservers. However, the ELK server would also work if it were placed within the same virtual network.
